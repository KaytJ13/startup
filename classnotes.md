## Github

Pretty basic coverage of commit/pull/push commands.

## AWS

Learned how to set up an instance with EC2, apply an elastic IP address, register a domain name with Route 53, and route said domain name to the instance. Also covered SSH into an instance, HTTP vs HTTPS, Caddy, TLS, etc.

Some helpful acronym definitions:
- **HTTP**: **H**yper**t**ext **T**ransport **P**rotocol
- **HTTPS**: **H**yper**t**ext **T**ransport **P**rotocol **S**ecure
- **TLS**: **T**ransport **L**ayer **S**ecurity

## HTML

**HTML** (**H**yper**t**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage) provides basic structure to web pages. Some helpful HTML things:
- Documents start with `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- head
    - meta
    - title
    - link to stylesheet/css file
        - E.g. 
        ```html
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="sheet.css">```
- body - has all of the main stuff
    - header
    - main
    - footer
    - within those, links (a), text (p), headers, div, form, button, etc.
    - At the bottom of body, link JS
        - E.g. 
        ```html
        <script src="email.js"></script>```

## Terminal Commands

- chmod - change permissions
- pwd - print working directory
- cd - change directory
- ls - list files
- vim/nano - text editors
- mkdir - make directory
- mv - move/rename
- rm - remove
- man - manual
- ssh - remote shell
- ps - processes
- wget - download files
- sudo - run as admin

## CSS Cheat Sheet

- "The innermost box holds the element's content. This is where things like the text or image of an element is displayed. Next comes the padding. The padding will inherit things like the background color. After padding is the border, which has properties like color, thickness and line style. The final box is the margin. The margin is considered external to the actual styling of the box and therefore only represents whitespace."
- "By default, the width and height of an element is defined by the width and height of the content box. You can change the box-sizing CSS property from the default value of content-box to border-box in order to redefine the width and height to also include the padding and the border."
- Helpful commands:
