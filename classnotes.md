## Github

Pretty basic coverage of commit/pull/push commands.

## AWS

Learned how to set up an instance with EC2, apply an elastic IP address, register a domain name with Route 53, and route said domain name to the instance. Also covered SSH into an instance, HTTP vs HTTPS, Caddy, TLS, etc.

Some helpful acronym definitions:
- **HTTP**: **H**yper**t**ext **T**ransport **P**rotocol
- **HTTPS**: **H**yper**t**ext **T**ransport **P**rotocol **S**ecure
- **TLS**: **T**ransport **L**ayer **S**ecurity
