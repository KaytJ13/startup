## Production Notes

### AWS

My IP address is: 44.205.238.241

My domain name is: [behalten.click](https://behalten.click)

### Caddy

Caddy allows HTTPS connections! I honestly don't remember what else this deliverable entailed.

### HTML

Built the basic structure for the site, leaving placeholders for most of the functionality. I kind of want to change my radio option lists to buttons, I think they don't look amazing, but I don't know for sure yet, so I'll leave it.

### CSS

I've been using a combination of bootstrap and css to do the syling. TBH, not really sure what I'm doing. But, it's going.

### React Part 1: Routing

Was cool. Would be super fun to also add an 'about' section that links through the Behalten logo. Just a thought. Not sure I want to do that all and also the formatting right now, though.

### React Part 2: Reactivity

I . . . didn't take notes

### All the problems:

- Only displaying one message at a time, and only from the other person.
- Chat with: ___ is no longer applicable, it's just a chat with everybody
